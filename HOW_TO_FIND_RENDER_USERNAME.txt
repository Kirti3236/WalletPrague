  HOW TO FIND YOUR RENDER USERNAME
================================================================================

There are several places where you can find your Render username:

================================================================================
METHOD 1: TOP RIGHT CORNER (Easiest)
================================================================================

1. Look at the TOP RIGHT corner of your Render dashboard
2. You'll see an icon (usually a letter or avatar)
3. Click on that icon
4. A dropdown menu will appear
5. Your username/email will be displayed there
6. It might show:
   - Your email address (if signed up with email)
   - Your GitHub username (if signed up with GitHub)
   - Or a display name

================================================================================
METHOD 2: ACCOUNT SETTINGS
================================================================================

1. Click on your profile icon (top right)
2. Click "Account Settings" or "Settings"
3. Go to "Profile" or "Account" section
4. Your username/email will be displayed there

================================================================================
METHOD 3: WORKSPACE NAME
================================================================================

1. Look at the TOP LEFT of the dashboard
2. You'll see "My Workspace" or your workspace name
3. Click on it
4. Your account information may be displayed there

================================================================================
METHOD 4: URL BAR (If visible)
================================================================================

Sometimes the username appears in the URL:
- https://dashboard.render.com/web/[username]
- Or in the workspace URL

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

✅ If you signed up with GitHub:
   - Your Render username is usually your GitHub username
   - Or the email associated with your GitHub account

✅ If you signed up with Email:
   - Your Render username is your email address
   - Or a username you created during signup

✅ Username vs Email:
   - Render may use your email as the username
   - Or you may have created a separate username
   - Both work for identification purposes

================================================================================
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT?
================================================================================

If you can't find the username:

1. Check the email you used to sign up
   - That's usually your username/identifier

2. Check your GitHub account (if signed up with GitHub)
   - Your GitHub username might be your Render username

3. Look at your workspace name
   - Sometimes the workspace name is the username

4. Contact Render Support
   - They can help you identify your account

================================================================================
FOR YOUR CREDENTIALS TEMPLATE
================================================================================

For the credentials template, you can use:

Username: [Your email address] OR [Your GitHub username]
OR
Username: [Whatever is shown in the top right corner]

The most important thing is:
- You can log in
- You can access the dashboard
- You can create services

The exact username format doesn't matter much for deployment purposes.

================================================================================
QUICK CHECK
================================================================================

Right now, on your Render dashboard:

1. Look at TOP RIGHT corner → Click the icon → See your name/email
2. That's your username/identifier!

If you see an email address, that's your username.
If you see a name, that's your display name (username might be email).
