  UPTIMEROBOT SETUP GUIDE
  Prevent Render Service from Spinning Down
================================================================================

You're on the UptimeRobot onboarding page. Here's what to do:

================================================================================
IMPORTANT: DO YOU HAVE YOUR RENDER API URL YET?
================================================================================

⚠️  BEFORE setting up UptimeRobot, you need:
   - Your Render service deployed and running
   - Your Render API URL (e.g., https://yapague-backend.onrender.com)

IF YOU HAVEN'T DEPLOYED TO RENDER YET:
   → Skip UptimeRobot setup for now
   → Deploy to Render first (follow RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.txt)
   → Come back to UptimeRobot after deployment
   → You can close this page and come back later

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR RENDER URL:
   → Continue with the setup below

================================================================================
STEP 1: ON THE CURRENT PAGE (Create Monitor)
================================================================================

You're on "Step 1 of 4" - "Create your first monitor"

1.1 Monitoring Type
   - It should already show: "HTTP / website monitoring"
   - This is CORRECT - leave it as is
   - Icon shows a browser window with "HTTP://"

1.2 URL to Monitor
   - In the "URL to monitor" field, enter your Render API URL
   - Format: https://your-service-name.onrender.com
   - Example: https://yapague-backend.onrender.com
   - Make sure it starts with "https://"
   - Don't add any path (just the root URL)

1.3 Create Monitor
   - Click the purple "Create monitor" button
   - This will create your first monitor

================================================================================
STEP 2: MONITOR SETTINGS (After Creating)
================================================================================

After clicking "Create monitor", you'll be taken to monitor settings.

2.1 Basic Settings
   - Friendly Name: "YaPague API" (or any name you prefer)
   - URL: Should already be filled (your Render URL)
   - Monitoring Interval: Select "5 minutes" (free tier allows this)
     * This is IMPORTANT - keeps your service alive!

2.2 Advanced Settings (Optional)
   - Alert Contacts: Set up email alerts (optional)
   - Public Status Page: Can enable later if needed

2.3 Save Settings
   - Click "Save" or "Update Monitor"

================================================================================
STEP 3: VERIFY MONITOR IS WORKING
================================================================================

3.1 Check Monitor Status
   - Go to UptimeRobot Dashboard
   - You should see your monitor listed
   - Status should show "Up" (green) if Render service is running
   - Status will show "Down" (red) if Render service isn't deployed yet

3.2 Test
   - UptimeRobot will ping your URL every 5 minutes
   - This prevents Render from spinning down after 15 minutes
   - Your service will stay alive 24/7!

================================================================================
WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE RENDER URL YET?
================================================================================

If you haven't deployed to Render yet:

OPTION 1: Skip for Now (Recommended)
   - Close this UptimeRobot page
   - Deploy to Render first (follow RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.txt)
   - Get your Render service URL
   - Come back to UptimeRobot later
   - Go to: https://uptimerobot.com
   - Click "Add New Monitor"
   - Then follow the steps above

OPTION 2: Create Monitor with Placeholder
   - Enter a placeholder URL: https://placeholder.onrender.com
   - Create the monitor
   - Later, edit the monitor and change the URL to your actual Render URL

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED SETTINGS FOR YOUR API
================================================================================

Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
URL: https://your-service-name.onrender.com
Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes (free tier)
Alert When: Down for 1 minute
HTTP Method: GET
Expected Status Code: 200 (or 200-299)

This configuration:
✅ Pings your API every 5 minutes
✅ Prevents 15-minute auto spin-down
✅ Keeps your service alive 24/7
✅ Sends alerts if service goes down

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Monitor shows "Down" immediately
SOLUTION:
- Check if Render service is deployed and running
- Verify the URL is correct
- Make sure URL starts with "https://"
- Check Render service logs for errors

PROBLEM: Can't find where to edit monitor
SOLUTION:
- Go to UptimeRobot Dashboard
- Click on your monitor name
- Click "Edit" button
- Update settings

PROBLEM: Want to change monitoring interval
SOLUTION:
- Free tier: 5 minutes minimum
- Paid tier: Can go lower (1 minute)
- 5 minutes is perfect for keeping service alive

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

Current Page: "Create your first monitor"
What to Enter:
  - Monitoring Type: HTTP / website monitoring (already selected)
  - URL: https://your-render-service.onrender.com

After Creating:
  - Set interval to 5 minutes
  - Monitor will ping every 5 minutes
  - Service stays alive!

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

After setting up UptimeRobot:

1. ✅ Monitor is created and running
2. ✅ Pinging your Render API every 5 minutes
3. ✅ Service will stay alive 24/7
4. ✅ No more 15-minute spin-down issues!

You're all set! 🎉
